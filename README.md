Webscraping with R

Webscraping with R software involves extracting data and information from webpages using code written in the R programming language. The process involves sending HTTP or HTTPS requests from R to the webpage(s) of interest, then using the information returned to extract relevant data.

In R, webscraping is often done with the help of libraries such as ‘rvest’, 'dplyr'. These libraries allow users to extract, parse and manipulate HTML and XML data from web pages. Once the data has been extracted, it can be transformed, analyzed and used for further research or analysis.

Webscraping with R can be a powerful tool for extracting data from webpages, especially for research or analysis purposes. However, it’s important to note that webscraping can be legally and ethically contentious, particularly when dealing with copyrighted material. It’s always recommended to check the website’s terms of use before scraping data to ensure that you are not violating any regulations.
